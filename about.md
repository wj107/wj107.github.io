I'm a teacher.  Formerly a math teacher.  Now, I'm teaching integrated STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) courses, invested in figuring out what replaces the old, traditional algebra, geometry, pre-calculus sequence.  My intuitive sense: computational thinking and data storytelling.

I have tons to learn; here I'm collecting vignettes of my working through various tasks in R.
