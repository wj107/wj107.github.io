I'm a teacher.  Formerly a math teacher.  Now, I'm teaching integrated STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) courses, invested in figuring out what replaces the old, traditional algebra, geometry, pre-calculus sequence.  My intuitive sense: computational thinking and data storytelling.

I am exploring ways to integrate computational thinking & data storytelling into a thematic curriculum: my school does not teach stand-alone STEM (or math, or science, etc) class.  The theme of my courses:  GLOBAL RESOURCES.  Water, fuel, and food.  

I have tons to learn; here I'm starting by collecting vignettes of my working through various random tasks in the (Linux) command line.  These are fun mini-exercises for my brain; using them as a starting point, I hope to add some tasks that might be more directly related to the classroom.

**Does the theme deserve a star?**
