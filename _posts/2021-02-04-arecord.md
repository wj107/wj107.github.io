## GROUND FLOOR

If I'm going to try and learn some code stuff, I oughta write out what I'm doing.  Otherwise... odds are I'm going to have to re-learn it 2 days later.

This has been a 'get around to it' thing for awhile.  Go time, now.

# ARECORD

There's utility for me to create dated voice memos.  Are there apps to do this? Sure, I'll bet.  Creating my own super simple version gets my brain thinking about the command line.

Apparently, there's a simple command-line app ``arecord`` that can easily record sound.

```
arecord test1.wav
```

Start talking, Ctrl+C to stop, and you have a voice memo ``test1.wav``.

# DATE

How to make it a bit more usable?  I'll bet there's more than a few features in the ``arecord`` function that could help.  Step one: make the filename automatically prefixed with the current date.

A quick google search tells me there's a command line tool ``date`` to get the current date & time.  If I want this info appended to a file name, I need to format it nicely.  From the manual page of ``date``, it looks like something along the lines of ``date -F %M%d%Y`` will give me what I want:  the ``-F`` sets format, the other stuff gives just month-day-year.

```
date -F %m%d%Y

date: invalid option -- 'F'
Try 'date --help' for more information.
```

Okay, so ``-F`` doesn't set format.  I was confused until I realized the specific formats for the date are at the bottom of the manual pageb; the command line syntax is at the top.  And no examples.  Command line manual pages... no my favorite.  Attempt two:

```
date +%m%d%Y
```

Got it!  (notice I switched ``%M`` to the desired ``%m`` There were multiple sub-attempts here, too...)

Time to figure out how to get this output into the command for ``arecord``.

# ARECORD & DATE

I can reasonably use the ``arecord`` and ``date`` commands.  How to tie them together??
